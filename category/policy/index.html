    <p><em><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3194" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/decentral1-224x300.jpg" alt="decentral1" width="224" height="300" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/decentral1-224x300.jpg 224w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/decentral1-768x1027.jpg 768w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/decentral1-766x1024.jpg 766w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/decentral1-668x893.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" />(I&#8217;ll be updating this regularly.)</em><br />
Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, has pulled together an amazing group of people for what he&#8217;s calling&#8211;with only a tiny amount of hyperbole&#8211;the <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">&#8220;Decentralized Web Summit.&#8221;</a>  Some of the &#8220;original architects&#8221; of this system&#8211;including Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee&#8211;are here, or will be, along with the younger and deeply committed architects of what we all agree we want in a general way. I&#8217;m one of the participants, but I&#8217;m in awe of the people around me.</p>
<p>Why is this necessary? Because our technology and communications are being recentralized, and controlled, by governments and big companies. They often mean well. And we, the users, often choose the convenience (or supposed safety) that come with letting others control our communications.</p>
<p>Today is <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/builders-day/">&#8220;Builders Day,&#8221;</a> in which we try to figure out what we want and what&#8217;s already available. Tomorrow is a more conference-type program, and Thursday is a meetup.</p>
<p>Brewster started the day by asking three key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we build a reliable web?</li>
<li>How can we make it more private?</li>
<li>And how do we keep it fun and evolving.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitchell Baker, who runs Mozilla, suggests three basic design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate. Safe instant access to content accessible via a universal address without the need for install.</li>
<li>Open. anyone can publish content without permission or barrier and provide access as they see fit.</li>
<li>Agency: user agent can choose how to interpret content provided by a service offering.</li>
</ul>
<p>For some great live-tweeting, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">Kevin Marks&#8217; feed</a> at Twitter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Builders are identifying themselves and what they want out of the day. Some have macro goals. I described mine this way: We need tech and communications that lets anyone speak, read, assemble and innovate without permission, and I want to help get that done. Others have more micro goals, such as fixing specific roadblocks to the decentralized net.</p>
<p>One of the best: &#8220;I want to see all the ones and zeros liberated forever,&#8221; says John Light of Bitseed.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/people/">see the participants here</a>. This is why I say I&#8217;m in awe.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We broke into groups, looking for areas of agreement and disagreement, plus ideas on how we can build or push forward decentralization. Then we merged groups (twice) and boiled it all down again, in order to have specific items to work on this afternoon.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s crucial to realize is that this is not an easy problem. Even the definitions are nuanced and complex. For example, what do we mean exactly by decentralization in the first place. There <em>have</em> to be some kinds of control points in some contexts.</p>
<p>We started with groups of six. My group(s) talked about such things as identity, encryption, and censorship. Then we compared notes (literally post-it notes) with another group and settled on some essentials to pursue later. Five other groups did likewise, and a spokesperson from each reported out to the rest of the participants.</p>
<p>I made an incredibly amateurish mobile phone video of the recommendations and posted it to the Archive (not, ahem, YouTube), using the new and wonderful mobile app called <a href="https://open-archive.net/">OpenArchive</a>, which runs on Android. (Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://archive.org/details/decentralized-web-summit--cikx">link to the page</a> where the video is hosted.)</p>
<p><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/decentralized-web-summit--cikx" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson">Van Jacobson</a> talked, in part, about the inherent problems with IP (Internet Protocol in this context, <em>not</em> &#8220;intellectual property). It was a miraculous achievement. But it isn&#8217;t scaling as well as we need to a global (and someday interplanetary) scale.</p>
<p>Jacobson is working on the <a href="http://named-data.net/project/faq/">NDN&#8211;Named Data Networking&#8221;&#8211;project</a> that aims to solve some of the growth issues. One key piece of this is where trust resides in the system. Today we get much of that trust from where the data originates, but perhaps we can get it from the data itself.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zooko">Zooko Wilcox</a> (<a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>) isn&#8217;t enamored of the centralize-everything mantra. He&#8217;s focused, he says, on a more fundamental goal: to promote human rights with technology.</p>
<p>He chides us for our one-time &#8220;technological determinism&#8221;&#8211;a belief that we could solve any problem with tech. If some of us thought the law, or at least judges, would come to see it our way, we were naive. We aren&#8217;t anymore.</p>
<p>People share resources for many reasons. One is money, and he says money creates stability in a key way. He likes &#8220;commercial structures&#8221; and open-source (&#8220;almost like science&#8221;) in different ways.</p>

He&#8217;s enabled chat, bulletin aboard and more. The service can be connected to Tor for enhanced privacy.</p>
<p>A question from the audience from someone who was &#8220;super-impressed&#8221; when he first looked at it. Is there away of importing from existing applications (such as this WordPress blog)? He&#8217;s aware of the problem, but since there&#8217;s no back-end this is difficult. (In other words, no.)</p>
<p>Still, super-impressive, an understatement.</p>

      <div class="entry-content e-content" itemprop="description articleBody">
    <p><em>At the <a href="http://journalismfestival.com">International Journalism Festival</a> in Perugia, Italy, this week, I gave a talk entitled &#8220;Why Journalists Should be Activists,&#8221; and apart from a few departures from the text below, here&#8217;s what I said:</em></p>
<p>Two months ago, a New York Times journalist, investigative reporter James Risen, went on Twitter to denounce the Obama administration&#8217;s attitude toward the press. The administration, he said, was the “greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation.”</p>
<p>Risen&#8217;s tirade became a topic of conversation in the community of people who watch and comment on journalism. Some said a reporter shouldn&#8217;t be expressing such thoughts publicly, because it might cause readers to question his – and his newspaper&#8217;s – commitment to objective reporting. But the newspaper&#8217;s editor in charge of of journalism standards told Margaret Sullivan, the Times&#8217; public editor,  that Risen had done the right thing.</p>
<p>“In general,” this editor said, “our reporters understand that they don’t and shouldn’t editorialize on issues we cover….I would put this in a different category.”</p>
<p>What category? Freedom of the press, of course. And he was right.</p>
<p>This was an important moment in the history of the New York Times. It was officially admitting that it is not neutral – isn&#8217;t pretending to be neutral – on this topic. The Times, as an organization, was taking an <em>activist</em> stance—far from its traditional role of observer and reporter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here to suggest to you today that all journalists need to think of themselves as activists in the world we now live in.</p>
<p>Before I explain this further, let me first explain what I mean by journalism and activism. Journalism can include so many things, ranging from deep investigative work to fluffy entertainment, but for our purposes I think of it as helping people understand they world they live in, so they can make better decisions about how they live. This often involves telling truth to the rich and powerful, and uncovering things that the rich and powerful would prefer to keep secret. It also involves being thorough, accurate, fair, independent and – this is not done enough – transparent. Journalism is vital to liberty, because it is a cornerstone of free speech.</p>
<p>For activism, I&#8217;ll simply use the dictionary definition: “the policy or action of using vigorous campaigning to bring about political or social change.” I&#8217;d add to that – sometimes activism is campaigning to stop things from happening.</p>
<p>In many parts of this world, doing real journalism is activism—because truth telling in some societies is an act designed to bring about change. I&#8217;m humbled by the people who risk their freedom, and sometimes their lives, to tell their fellow citizens and the rest of the world what is happening where they live. You will be hearing from one of them in the next talk.</p>
<p>In the western democracies with a more robust tradition of free speech and a free press, the idea of journalists as activists is often seen as taking sides in contravention of journalistic norms. But there&#8217;s a long and honorable history of what we call “advocacy journalism” – we could easily call it “activist journalism” – exposing injustices with the absolute goal of stirring public anger, and then public action to bring about change. In America, the people we called muckrakers in the early 20th century did brilliant journalism of this kind. Today filmmaker Laura Poitras, who&#8217;ll be speaking here by video this evening, and her colleagues are among many others who are carrying on that tradition. (Do see CitizenFour, by the way; it&#8217;s brilliant.)</p>
<p>Also today, we have a new category of journalism in this realm – journalism being done by people who are advocates first, and media producers second. I&#8217;m talking about Human Rights Watch, which consistently brilliant reporting on human rights issues around the world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization in my own country that consistently does some of the best journalism – in several senses of the word – about threats to our fundamental liberties. In the interest of transparency, I should mention that my fantastically talented nephew, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, works with the ACLU.</p>
<p>In the past, these organizations and NGOs like them around the world were doing the journalism. But to get it seen they had to persuade traditional media organizations to care about, and then to publish or broadcast, reports based on the information the NGOs had collected. Now, in the digital age, every organization of any kind is also a media enterprise, and can go more directly to the public. Collaborations with traditional journalists are still helpful, but no longer as absolutely necessary as they were. We journalists should be welcoming the advocates to the journalism ecosystem – and recognizing them for their work. By the way, the American Civil Liberties Union probably litigates more open-records cases on issues related to liberty, using the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, than all traditional news organizations put together.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying all advocates are doing journalism – far from it. In many cases we&#8217;re getting untrue, unfair propaganda. We need know the difference, as journalists and as members of the public – that&#8217;s another talk entirely.</p>
<p>So we have a baseline of journalistic activism – all around us and often incredibly valuable – on a variety of topics. It makes many traditional journalists, especially in my country, uncomfortable. Why? Because we&#8217;re told, again and again, that one of journalism&#8217;s core values is objectivity and/or neutrality.</p>
<p>But even those journalists who worship at the altar of objectivity should recognize that on at least some issues, they cannot possibly be objective. Or at least, they should not be. On some issues we have to take stands, even though those stands may put us at policy odds with the people and institutions we cover.</p>
<p>What are these issues? The New York Times has picked one: freedom of the press. I hope no one here would dispute the need to take a stand for press freedom.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d suggest this is only one of several policy issues where journalists who do not take activists stands are unfit to call themselves journalists. They all come under larger topics that are at the core of liberty, among them: freedom of expression, freedom to associate, freedom to collaborate, freedom to innovate.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t be neutral here. We should be openly biased toward openness and freedom. Period.</p>
<p>Powerful governments and corporations are leading the attack against these core values, usually in the name of protecting us or giving us more convenience. In the process, these powerful entities are creating a host of choke points. They&#8217;re doing their best to lock down a lot of our computing and communications, and creating a system of control by others over what we say and do online.</p>
<p>This is a betrayal of the Internet’s decentralized promise, where speech and innovation and collaboration would often start at the edges of this network of networks, where no one needed permission to do those things. Choke points mean we have to ask permission.</p>
<p>What are these choke points? The most obvious is what’s happening to the Internet itself. Start with direct censorship, a growing trend in far too many parts of the world. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone here would object to journalistic activism on this front.</p>
<p>Surveillance, too, has become a method for government — often working with big companies — to keep track of what journalists and activists are doing—going way beyond the mission of stopping terrorism and solving major crimes. Surveillance is having a measurable chilling effect on freedom of expression, and no society that exists under pervasive surveillance can claim to enjoy basic liberty. We know from history that it deadens innovation and culture. If we don&#8217;t actively oppose mass surveillance, we&#8217;re not fit to call ourselves journalists.</p>
<p>Another choke point is the telecommunications industry. In America and many other countries&#8211; and often in concert with governments&#8211; big telecoms say they should have the right to decide what bits of information get to people’s devices in what order and at what speed, or whether they get there at all. This is what the network neutrality debate is all about in the U.S.: whether we, at the edges of the networks, or the telecom companies that provide the access to the Internet, get to make those decisions. If we don&#8217;t campaign for open and truly competitive networks, we&#8217;re not fit to call ourselves journalists.</p>
<p>“Intellectual property” is a valuable concept, but it&#8217;s also a choke point. Hollywood and its allies try to lock down or control innovative technologies that threaten incumbent companies&#8217; business models. They&#8217;re abusing the patent and copyright systems, among other tactics. And they never, ever quit. The latest sneak attack from this crowd comes in a secretly negotiated treaty called the Trans Pacific Partnership is the latest attempt by the intellectual property cartel to prevent innovation, and speech, that it can&#8217;t control—among many other bad effects. (We know about some of this because Wikileaks has published drafts of several chapters of this immense treaty.) If we don&#8217;t explain to the public what is happening, and then campaign for a more open process and for the right to innovate, we are unfit to call ourselves journalists.</p>
<p>Speaking of Wikileaks, let&#8217;s mention another choke point: the major payment systems  like Mastercard, Visa and PayPal. They almost shut down Wikileaks with a funding blackout. Only a few news organizations noticed, much less complained. Yet if you can&#8217;t get paid for your work, how do you plan to put food on your table? The centralized payment industry holds enormous power, by proxy, over journalists&#8217; ability to make a living. If we don&#8217;t campaign against its arbitrary decisions, we&#8217;re not fit to call ourselves journalists.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s be honest about something: We&#8217;ve helped create some of the choke points — by choosing convenience over liberty in relying centralized Internet platforms like Facebook and Twitter and Google. I have to note that these companies do provide useful services. And they are often trying to be advocates for free speech, though not consistently.</p>
<p>But do journalists understand that the Internet is getting new editors, namely the people who work for some of those companies? Do journalists understand that by feeding Facebook they are feeding a company that will be their biggest financial competitor? If this was only a business issue I wouldn&#8217;t raise it. But it’s much more than that. This is about whether the terms of service at a tiny number of giant companies, as opposed to the First Amendment and other laws like it, will effectively determine our free speech rights. If we aren&#8217;t activists for open, decentralized technology and communications, we are unfit to call ourselves journalists.</p>
<p>The corporate online powers are also spying on us. It&#8217;s their business model. Journalists are waking up to this, more so in Europe than in the U.S., but we all need to be thinking harder about how companies can use and abuse big data. If we aren&#8217;t campaigning for privacy from corporations, not just governments, we are unfit to call ourselves journalists.</p>
<p>I’m not asking journalists to ignore nuances in any of this; life and business and policy truly are complicated. But when it comes to things that directly threaten perhaps our the most fundamental liberties—without which journalism is vastly more difficult if not impossible—there&#8217;s no excuse for failing to explain what’s at stake. Nor is there any excuse for failing to take more direct action.</p>
<p>Core freedoms – of expression, association, and more – should be everyone’s right. Journalists have a duty to be their defenders.</p>
<p>So I ask this of my journalism friends: Take stands, loudly and proudly. Be activists. Unless you prefer a world of choke points and control by others, this is part of your job.</p>

      <div class="entry-content e-content" itemprop="description articleBody">
    <p>Patrick Frey, who blogs and tweets under the pseudonym Patterico, picked an odd fight yesterday over what should have been a simple disagreement. In the process he made false statements about what I want to see in telecom/media policy.</p>
<p>First, though, here&#8217;s where we do agree: The FCC&#8217;s move to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/02/26/the_fcc_will_reclassify_broadband_as_a_utility_under_title_ii_so_it_can.html">reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers</a> could have negative consequences. If Frey posted that on Twitter, I&#8217;d retweet him in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>While I support the commission&#8217;s decision, have argued for it, and have publicly worried about the potential unintended consequences, I don&#8217;t assume these consequences are inevitable. Frey does. But to make his point, he resorted to tactics that surprised me, given my prior respect for his work.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s <a href="http://patterico.com/2015/03/14/journalism-professor-dan-gillmor-supports-federal-regulation-of-the-new-printing-press/">blogged about all this at Patterico.com</a>, in a tendentiously titled post that extends his original false claim. I&#8217;m responding to the central points in that blog post, not the irrelevant personal stuff or the <a href="https://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/576801633675300864">&#8220;nuance-free slogans and analogies&#8221;</a> he barraged me (and his followers) with on Twitter, which once again demonstrates its unfitness for serious conversation. Read it and come back. I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>For those of you who didn&#8217;t read his post, here&#8217;s how Frey picked the fight. A blog post by news industry analyst Ken Doctor about <a href="http://t.co/tb6V95VeoK">plunging single-copy sales</a> of newspapers led me to tweet that by drastically hiking prices of single copies, newspapers had found a new way to commit suicide.</p>
<p>This led to Frey&#8217;s opening salvo:</p>
<blockquote><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/dangillmor">@dangillmor</a> Final blow for newspapers: they increasingly rely on the Web, and people like you want the government regulating it. <a href="https://twitter.com/kdoctor">@kdoctor</a></p>
<p>— (@Patterico) <a href="https://twitter.com/Patterico/status/576798822090706944">March 14, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There are only two rational ways to read this. 1. I want the government to regulate the Web, and by extension what people post on it. 2. I want government to regulate the Web, but I&#8217;m too dense to understand what that might lead to. From <a href="https://twitter.com/Patterico/status/576805630205255680">his later statements</a>, I gather that he meant the second interpretation. Both are false (never mind conflating the Web and the Internet, which as you&#8217;ll see below he did correct). Since I write publicly about telecom policy, and since I&#8217;ve respected Frey (and said so in my book <em>We the Media </em>a decade ago<em>)</em>, I was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>(I called his tweet a lie, and said I was surprised that he would say such a thing. As he has pointed out, a lie is a deliberate, knowing falsehood. Since I can&#8217;t read his mind, I&#8217;ve retracted that word. I&#8217;ll stick with &#8220;false&#8221; to describe what he wrote.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the meat of Frey&#8217;s blog post (bold text in the original):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Newspapers are increasingly reliant on the Internet to communicate with their audience.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The FCC this year is assuming regulatory control over the Internet.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Seeing those two facts together should frighten all Americans.</strong> With the death of newsprint, the federal government (under the guise of Net Neutrality, which Gillmor supports) is putting regulatory control over the new printing press — the Internet — in the hands of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the Internet the new printing press? Sure, and a lot more. Is the FCC assuming regulatory control over the Internet? It is asserting regulatory power over one (relatively) small part, in a small but crucial way. It is working to ensure that the people who create media and other services, using that printing press and other tools, are treated fairly by the cartel of corporate giants that has taken unprecedented control&#8211;over how what we create may (or even will) be seen by others who want to see it.</p>
<p>The promise of the Internet &#8220;network of networks&#8221; was in its radical decentralization. Innovation and true freedom of expression would originate at the edges of those networks, where we wouldn&#8217;t need anyone&#8217;s permission to innovate or speak because we were free of centralized control.</p>
<p>The corporate giants that control most of the on-ramps to the fabled information superhighway want the right to decide what bits of information get delivered at what speed and in what order, or if they&#8217;ll get delivered at all, to those of us requesting the information. And they insist they&#8217;d never, ever abuse that control. (They <a href="https://www.aclu.org/net-neutrality#abuses1">already have</a>.)</p>
<p>Big Telecom doesn&#8217;t operate the 21st Century printing presses. You and I do. Big Telecom isn&#8217;t the Internet; it is <em>part</em> of the Internet. But it has become the antithesis of the Internet&#8217;s promise&#8211;a centralized choke point.</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s Title II decision recognizes the choke point for what it is, and attempts to mitigate the worst effects. The ruling says, essentially, that we&#8211;you and I, at the edges of the network of networks&#8211;should decide on our own priorities for what we access from digital networks. It says the centralized cartel shouldn&#8217;t make those decisions for us.</p>
<p>Frey hearkens back to the early days of the FCC and its subsequent control over broadcasting to frighten us with the specter of FCC Internet content regulation, citing the commission&#8217;s pernicious (we agree again!) regulation over broadcasters&#8217; content through the decades. If there was ever a need for policing televised wardrobe malfunctions in an era of government-limited broadcast outlets&#8211;there was not, in my view&#8211;it ended when the Internet gave us, in theory, unlimited multidirectional channels of communications.</p>
<p>But Frey, citing a slew heavy-handed government threats and actions against broadcasters, predicts the same is in store for the Internet as a result of Title II reclassification. He&#8217;s saying, This is what governments do, and it&#8217;ll happen again. (He mistakenly says the FCC has turned the ISPs into utilities, when in fact they&#8217;ve been reclassified as &#8220;common carriers&#8221;&#8211;the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/dont-call-them-utility-rules-the-fccs-net-neutrality-regime-explained/">difference is important and highly relevant</a> in this debate.)</p>
<p>Frey&#8217;s argument is a bit like saying government regulations about auto safety, such as requiring seat belts, is just the first step toward the government deciding precisely where you can drive. I suppose that&#8217;s possible, but one doesn&#8217;t inevitably lead to the other.</p>
<p>Governments don&#8217;t always go too far. When they&#8217;re &#8220;of the people, by the people, for the people,&#8221; we have a say in what happens.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s founders had the right idea when they established freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion and more in the First Amendment. America hasn&#8217;t always lived up to these ideals, which are always under attack from people and organizations who worry about too much freedom. But the FCC decision on net neutrality very much honors the founders&#8217; intent.</p>
<p>The FCC has explicitly said it would apply forbearance (a key word in the legal and regulatory arena), making clear in the rules what it won&#8217;t do&#8211;which covers the parade of horribles even supporters of Title II fear. (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/10/23/meet-forbearance-the-obscure-governing-tool-that-just-might-resolve-the-net-neutrality-debate/">a Q&amp;A</a> that explains the concept.) And never mind that the public is getting better at understanding what the Internet is and how it works&#8211;not to mention increasingly wary of centralized power and downright allergic to government control of what we can read or write.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one bit of forbearance I wish the FCC hadn&#8217;t done, in what&#8217;s called &#8220;unbundling&#8221; of the last mile (to our homes and businesses). Given the monopoly/cartel nature of the staggeringly profitable ISP business we&#8217;d have been better off if the commission had required the ISPs, particularly the cable companies, to let other companies create ISPs on &#8220;their&#8221; lines. (Unbundling, by the way, has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/we-dont-need-net-neutrality-we-need-competition/">a track record in several other countries</a>. It&#8217;s not <em>the</em> answer but it can help in the short run.</p>
<p>This is exactly what our oppressive government did in the early days of the public Internet. In the 1990s there were thousands of small ISPs competing for our business on wired phone lines. The phone companies were not permitted to discriminate against them, because they were common carriers. And the Internet took off in large part because there was vast, and valuable competition for our business, something the anti-net-neutrality forces never seem to remember.</p>
<p>On one other key point, Frey and I agree entirely, even if we&#8217;d undoubtedly get there by different routes: the best fix to this situation is competition. There is a small amount of competition now, but the overall American &#8220;broadband&#8221; marketplace is a parody of genuine capitalism.</p>
<p>The dominant ISPs got where they are because the marketplace was rigged in their favor. They built &#8220;their&#8221; networks on the backs of government-granted monopolies in the first place. Then they leveraged their built-in advantages&#8211;including cozy deals with various governments&#8211;to create a cartel that will be immensely difficult to dislodge, though we should keep trying.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how we could have genuine competition, or move closer to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require monopoly/oligopoly businesses created through special favors to then make their facilities&#8211;lines, towers, etc.&#8211;available to competitors until such time as there&#8217;s actual competition for what they do;</li>
<li>Require communities to make their rights of way accessible to all competitors, which would help create the conditions for competition, though it wouldn&#8217;t undo the unfair advantages the cartel already possesses as a result of its monopoly days;</li>
<li>Forbid state governments from preventing municipalities from installing publicly owned broadband networks (the carriers have &#8220;persuaded&#8221; lots of state governments to enact competition-killing rules of this kind, and the FCC&#8217;s latest rules <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-preempts-laws-restricting-community-broadband-nctn">wisely pre-empt such laws</a>);</li>
<li>Free up vastly more unregulated spectrum&#8211;ideally created from the airwaves we unconscionably gave to the national and local broadcasters&#8211;letting competition emerge there the way it did in wi-fi;</li>
<li>Promote, in that spectrum, the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2003/03/12/spectrum/">promising area of &#8220;smart radios,&#8221;</a> recognizing that there is a spectrum &#8220;shortage&#8221; caused by &#8220;interference&#8221; largely because traditional radios have been so inefficient;</li>
<li>And make many other moves aimed at creating the conditions where genuine competition can emerge and thrive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chances that the telecoms and their owned-and-operated legislatures would allow actual competition are close to zero. If the opponents of net neutrality really believed in competition, they&#8217;d push for something like this. I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll settle, with misgivings, for Title II. And, working with the enormous group of pro-net-neutrality folks who&#8217;ve demonstrated expertise and good will on this issue, I&#8217;ll do my best to see that it doesn&#8217;t boomerang on all of us. Fear-mongering, even if it&#8217;s well-intended, won&#8217;t help anyone.</p>
<p>(Note: I&#8217;ve updated this post with several small tweaks.)</p>

    <p>The Guardian has decided as an institution to put <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/environment">climate change front and center</a> in its journalism. Alan Rusbridger, who&#8217;s stepping down as the organization&#8217;s top editor this summer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/06/climate-change-guardian-threat-to-earth-alan-rusbridger">put it this way in an editorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, in the time left to me as editor, I thought I would try to harness the Guardian’s best resources to describe what is happening and what – if we do nothing – is almost certain to occur, a future that <a class=" u-underline" href="http://kevinanderson.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Opinion-Piece-by-Anderson-for-SvD-Swedish-Daily-Newspaper-Nov-2012.pdf" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link">one distinguished scientist has termed</a> as “incompatible with any reasonable characterisation of an organised, equitable and civilised global community”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what journalism needs to be, and what it needs to do: Stand for something and then put <em>all</em> available resources behind making it happen. This couldn&#8217;t be further from the false neutrality of so much modern &#8220;journalism.&#8221; Nor could it be more important to make a more common practice.</p>
<p>In my last book, <em>Mediactive,</em> I made a list of what I thought news organizations should do in this digital age when the competition for people&#8217;s attention has never been greater. One of those recommendations went this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>The more we believed an issue was of importance to our community, the more relentlessly we’d stay on top of it ourselves. If we concluded that continuing down a current policy path was a danger, we’d actively campaign to persuade people to change course. This would have meant, for example, loud and persistent warnings about the danger of the blatantly obvious housing/financial bubble that inflated during the past decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>What the Guardian is doing about climate change strikes me as a perfect&#8211;maybe <em>the</em> perfect&#8211;example of why campaigning should be an essential part of the craft. It&#8217;s long overdue for other news organizations to pay attention, and get active, themselves.</p>

    <p>Journalism watcher and professor Jay Rosen&#8217;s <a href="http://pressthink.org/2014/11/how-to-be-literate-in-whats-changing-journalism/">&#8220;How to be literate in what’s changing journalism&#8221;</a> is a solid list of things tomorrow&#8217;s journalists will need to understand, and in many cases adopt. As he wisely does in his PressThink posts, Jay asks at the end what he&#8217;s missing.</p>
<p>From my perspective, there&#8217;s one more major element that every journalist, today and tomorrow, truly needs to grasp and deal with: who&#8217;s in control.</p>
<p>The answer, increasingly: Not us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written many times in recent years about the dangers we face as a society as centralized entities, primarily governments and corporations, are taking control of the Internet away from those of us who use technology from the edges of the network of networks. The promise of the Net, and of the personal devices that emerged starting with the PC, was a radically decentralized system of computing and communications. Conversations and innovation, in that system, started and thrived at the networks&#8217; edges, not in the center.</p>
<p>Some vital functions are being recentralized, through technological developments and political fiat. Governments that feel threatened by technology increasingly use our devices and systems to spy on us, and much worse.</p>
<p>In many cases, governments act (read: are paid) to protect legacy industries that loathe the liberty that technology can spark. Industries like Hollywood push harder and harder for laws giving them the authority to determine what innovations will emerge, especially if these breakthroughs threaten legacy business models that no longer make sense in a networked arena.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, corporate centralization is burning through the ecosystem. Facebook and Google, in particular, have taken control of wide swaths of the Internet&#8217;s key functions. Facebook is becoming what amounts to an alternative Internet &#8212; literally so in some countries where mobile dominates &#8212; and its growing power over content, along with Google&#8217;s search dominance, should worry everyone. (Jay alludes to this in his first point, I should note.)</p>
<p>That centralization may pale next to what telecommunications carriers are attempting: control over how information moves in and across our networks. In the U.S. wired-Internet market, local duopolies of cable and phone companies &#8212; the cable companies are effectively monopolies when it comes to actual broadband, not the pathetic imitation that phone-line DSL service provides &#8212; are insisting on the right to decide what bits of information get delivered to our devices in what order and at what speed, or whether they get delivered at all. Mobile service is completely deregulated on this score. Federal regulators, claiming the opposite, give the carriers more and more power, and the FCC&#8217;s pathetic mutterings about restricting carrier dominance tell us network neutrality is on its last legs.</p>
<p>All of the above trends are relevant to journalism. Which is why journalists need to understand at least these key points (among many others in this context):</p>
<ol>
<li>Carrier dominance is the ultimate in media consolidation. If they get away with their power play, they will determine almost everyone&#8217;s future in the media world. They will decide which content, and to some degree which innovation, lives or dies.</li>
<li>Facebook and Google &#8212; with Twitter looming on the horizon &#8212; are not just incredibly powerful and ubiquitous platforms. They are competitors for advertising, eyeballs and time. Journalists who use Facebook to promote their material &#8212; or, with supreme stupidity, as a host for their material &#8212; are also feeding a beast that intends to consume them.</li>
<li>Government surveillance and censorship are acts of control that threaten all serious journalism.</li>
<li>The Copyright Cartel&#8217;s efforts to restrict deployment of technology that threatens traditional business models is a threat to all innovation of the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, Jay is entirely right to push journalists to understand the items he mentions. It&#8217;s a great list. I hope he&#8217;ll add &#8220;who&#8217;s in control&#8221; as another.</p>

    <p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/opinion/brooks-weed-been-there-done-that.html">his column today</a>, David Brooks frets about legalizing marijuana, because it&#8217;s bad for society.</p>
<p>As an exercise, I changed every reference of marijuana to beer, and smoking to drinking (and Colorado to the United States). Here&#8217;s the Brooks column with those edits:</p>
<blockquote><p>For a little while in my teenage years, my friends and I drank beer. It was fun. I have some fond memories of us all being silly together. I think those moments of uninhibited frolic deepened our friendships.</p>
<p>But then we all sort of moved away from it. I don’t remember any big group decision that we should give up beer. It just sort of petered out, and, before long, we were scarcely using it.</p>
<p>We didn’t give it up for the obvious health reasons: that it is addictive in about one in six teenagers; that drinking and driving is a good way to get yourself killed; that young people who drink go on to suffer I.Q. loss and perform worse on other cognitive tests.</p>
<p>I think we gave it up, first, because we each had had a few embarrassing incidents. Drunk people do stupid things (that’s basically the point). I drank one day during lunch and then had to give a presentation in English class. I stumbled through it, incapable of putting together simple phrases, feeling like a total loser. It is still one of those embarrassing memories that pop up unbidden at 4 in the morning.</p>
<p>We gave it up, second, I think, because one member of our clique became a full-on drunk. He may have been the smartest of us, but something sad happened to him as he sunk deeper into alcoholic life.</p>
<p>Third, most of us developed higher pleasures. Drinking was fun, for a bit, but it was kind of repetitive. Most of us figured out early on that drinking beer doesn’t really make you funnier or more creative (academic studies more or less confirm this). We graduated to more satisfying pleasures. The deeper sources of happiness usually involve a state of going somewhere, becoming better at something, learning more about something, overcoming difficulty and experiencing a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.</p>
<p>One close friend devoted himself to track. Others fell deeply in love and got thrills from the enlargements of the heart. A few developed passions for science or literature.</p>
<p>Finally, I think we had a vague sense that drinking beer was not exactly something you were proud of yourself for. It’s not something people admire. We were in the stage, which I guess all of us are still in, of trying to become more integrated, coherent and responsible people. This process usually involves using the powers of reason, temperance and self-control — not qualities one associates with being high.</p>
<p>I think we had a sense, which all people have, or should have, that the actions you take change you inside, making you a little more or a little less coherent. Not drinking, or only drinking sporadically, gave you a better shot at becoming a little more integrated and interesting. Drinking all the time seemed likely to cumulatively fragment a person’s deep center, or at least not do much to enhance it.</p>
<p>So, like the vast majority of people who try beer, we aged out. We left beer behind. I don’t have any problem with somebody who gets high from time to time, but I guess, on the whole, I think being drunk is not a particularly uplifting form of pleasure and should be discouraged more than encouraged.</p>
<p>We now have a nation that has gone into the business of effectively encouraging beer use. By making beer legal, we are creating a situation in which the price will drop substantially. One RAND study suggests that prices could plummet by up to 90 percent, before taxes and such. As prices drop and legal fears go away, usage is bound to increase. This is simple economics, and it is confirmed by much research. The end of prohibition, in other words, is producing more users.</p>
<p>The people who debate these policy changes usually cite the health risks users would face or the tax revenues the state might realize. Many people these days shy away from talk about the moral status of beer use because that would imply that one sort of life you might choose is better than another sort of life.</p>
<p>But, of course, these are the core questions: Laws profoundly mold culture, so what sort of community do we want our laws to nurture? What sort of individuals and behaviors do our governments want to encourage? I’d say that in healthy societies government wants to subtly tip the scale to favor temperate, prudent, self-governing citizenship. In those societies, government subtly encourages the highest pleasures, like enjoying the arts or being in nature, and discourages lesser pleasures, like being drunk.</p>
<p>In legalizing beer, citizens of America are, indeed, enhancing individual freedom. But they are also nurturing a moral ecology in which it is a bit harder to be the sort of person most of us want to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here are a couple of questions for David Brooks. Do you use alcohol? Was Prohibition a good idea?</p>

    <p>An ugly mood in America today&#8230;</p>
<p>At a bed &amp; breakfast table this morning, the conversation among the B&amp;B customers turned to yesterday&#8217;s verdict in the C**** A****** trial. People were incredulous, bordering on angry, at the acquittal. They _knew_ this was wrongly decided, and never mind the damn jury.</p>
<p>One woman announced that her friend watched the trial on TV and was certain that the defendant was guilty of murder. Another said, &#8220;She went partying after hearing her child was missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked, as mildly as I could, if being a bad person is grounds for a murder conviction, and who were we to tell the jurors, who were actually there in the courtroom for the trial and ultimately didn&#8217;t believe this case was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, to say their doubts were unreasonable.</p>
<p>I got a couple of hard looks from others at the table. Happily, the conversation turned to other topics.</p>
<p>Then, on Twitter, I saw reports that the ever-odious Nancy Grace had essentially told a national TV audience that the verdict was BS. I know, this is her stock in trade: inciting the public to hate defendants she dislikes. But it&#8217;s dangerous stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe C.A. did it. Instead of bemoaning a verdict of not guilty, though, we should be cheering a system where, at least on occasion, the presumption of innocence &#8212; and a requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt &#8212; still means something.</p>
