      <div class="entry-content e-content" itemprop="description articleBody">
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is a reprint (with permission) of a column I wrote for the San Jose Mercury News in 2004, during that year&#8217;s presidential campaign. I&#8217;ve added a few links. In several respects I&#8217;ve changed my mind about real-time fact-checking, but I&#8217;d still like to see a more &#8220;we&#8221; approach to debates than the &#8220;I&#8221; crapola we have now.</em></p>
<p>In the 2004 presidential campaign&#8217;s latest detour into relative trivia, there&#8217;s been a small uproar over whether President Bush was wearing <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/12/bush_wireless_coaching/">some kind of audio receiver</a> during one or more of the debates with John Kerry. The implication was that the president might have been getting unfair coaching.</p>
<p>Bush and his people deny they broke the rules prohibiting such devices or other aids. I don&#8217;t see any big reason to doubt them even if the bulge in the back of Bush&#8217;s suit was remarkably rectangular.</p>
<p>I would argue that in this case the rules need updating. Voters would have been better off if the candidates had all kinds of technology at their disposal, so they could double-check their own facts and precisely rebut opponents&#8217; misstatements.</p>
<p>In the Information Age, the ability to find relevant information quickly and use it intuitively will be at least as important as the ability to memorize numbers or slogans. This will be as true for everyday people as presidents and their staffs, and powerful tools will soon be at our beck and call.</p>
<p>Technological aids of this sort aren&#8217;t new, though their use has sometimes been contested. Remember the debate when children first started taking calculators to school? It was assumed (with some truth) that kids would forgethow to add and multiply the old-fashioned way, using a pencil and paper.</p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus">abacus</a> and <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">slide rule</a> predated the electronic calculator. Were those shortcuts also a problem?</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so long ago, meanwhile, that we had to go to the public library to look up facts in books or periodicals we didn&#8217;t own. I love libraries, and they&#8217;re still essential institutions for many things, but more and more data and facts can be found online.</p>
<p>School officials have gone into panic mode because students are telling each other answers to specific questions via mobile phone text messages. Maybe the answer is to make most testing an &#8221;open book&#8221; process, where the student ultimately shows a command, or not, of the subject in other ways than rote memorization.</p>
<p>As information technology becomes embedded into more of what we touch, and as wired and wireless networks become more ubiquitous, we can expect to be able to look things up pretty much everywhere. This will be no more unusual for people tomorrow than it was to pull out a calculator a decade ago.</p>
<p>How far might this go? Advances in display technology suggest that eyeglasses will soon become excellent <a href="http://plus.google.com/+projectglass">data displays</a>, and eventually digital technology will augment our eyes directly. Audio will have a similar trajectory.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve often said I&#8217;d like to have a music implant in the brain, letting me &#8221;know&#8221; the scales without thinking about them. This wouldn&#8217;t make me more musical, but it would free some time for more valuable kinds of practice and creativity.</p>
<p>As facts, figures and other data become instantly retrievable, many kinds of endeavors will change. One is journalism.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that a journalist in the future is interviewing a corporate chief executive or politician, and that the reporter can double-check what he or she has been told on the spot. Imagine further that the journalist is broadcasting the interview in real time to a cadre of experts who can suggest follow-up questions or point out misstatements on the fly. Interviews would never be the same.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=abacus&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=abacus&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=fact+checking&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=01p7UO_pKsT2iwKT1oGoBw&amp;ved=0CCYQqAI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=3b3178f6e0017928&amp;bpcl=35277026&amp;biw=1284&amp;bih=676">&#8221;fact squads&#8221;</a> major news organizations assembled during the debates to check candidates&#8217; statements were operating in something close to real time, but not close enough for me. I would prefer to see TV networks flash corrections on the screen as soon as they caught the candidate in a lie. Distracting? Perhaps, but maybe the candidates would lie less often or at least less brazenly.</p>
<p>Even more valuable would be giving the candidates more tools to correct each other. I would build a personal computer into each podium, connected to whatever online resources the candidate and his staff found useful.</p>
<p>I would hate to see candidates and officials rely entirely on technological props, because preparing for debates and press conferences is a vital way for politicians to synthesize details into coherent policies. I would hope for some balance, and that we could find out when someone was just reciting someone else&#8217;s lines on the fly.</p>
<p>But when I vote for a candidate, I&#8217;m not looking for a wonk whose chief skill seems to be rattling off facts and figures. I&#8217;m looking for people with strategic vision and the ability to lead. Leave the memorization &#8212; the details &#8212; to other people, and to Google.</p>

    <p>The New York Times has given anonymous sources a platform to slime other people in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/us/politics/romney-aides-scratch-their-heads-over-eastwoods-speech.html">this story</a> about the Romney camp&#8217;s reaction to Clint Eastwood&#8217;s beyond-bizarre appearance at the Republican National Convention.</p>
<p>One person from inside the campaign is quoted, and he&#8217;s one of the people who was attacked. On Twitter I called this (and it wasn&#8217;t a compliment) &#8220;[s]tandard NY Times political journalism,&#8221; a reference to the Paper of Record&#8217;s unfortunate propensity to use anonymous sources, often in violation of internal policies it routinely ignores.</p>
<p>A Times editor <a href="http://twitter.com/davidjoachim/status/241586304134037505">challenge my take</a>.  &#8220;[W]ould you really expect on-the-record reax from Romney aides?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;And if not, don&#8217;t write the story?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course I expect cowardly attacks from political operatives. That&#8217;s the nature of the political system.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t expect journalists to be complicit in the sleaze, even though that&#8217;s become a feature of modern journalism. It doesn&#8217;t have to be, and the Times should lead the way in saying no.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know &#8212; when pigs fly.</p>

    <p>UPDATED</p>
<p>Andrew Breitbart is incensed at a Twitter tweet I posted, pointing at a Little Green Footballs <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/39207_Breitbart.com_Commenters_Respond_to_Obama_Speech_with_Deluge_of_Overt_Racism">post</a> that cited some ugly and grossly racist comments on Breitbart&#8217;s site. Given his history &#8212; especially in the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201007200047">Shirley Sherrod</a> affair &#8212; I found myself sadly unsurprised that he&#8217;d provide a platform for such stuff, and expressed that opinion.</p>
<p>In a series of reply tweets, Breitbart said a) he provides an un-moderated platform; b) he loathes the racist stuff; and c) he doesn&#8217;t tolerate this at all. He also suggested &#8212; I&#8217;d love to see evidence for this &#8212; that left-wingers are using his open comment system to leave at least some of the hateful comments in question.  Meanwhle, his supporters, who are legion, demanded to know why I don&#8217;t denounce the comment garbage elsewhere. Well, I do and <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2011/01/05/fixing_anonymity">have</a>; my special contempt is reserved for unmoderated anonymous comments where the purpose is to attack someone, which can turn threads are cesspools &#8212; and I am constantly surprised that big media sites, especially, allow their comment threads to be so putrid. This stuff is a pox on all of us. I don&#8217;t know why Breitbart allows it at all, given his expressions of disgust (which in fact makes it surprising, not unsurprising, that he does, even briefly) at the hateful stuff, but I will take him at his word that he doesn&#8217;t like or endorse it.</p>
<p>BUT: Whatever his policies may be, and however wrong I think he is to have unmoderated comments, Breitbart was absolutely right that I should have contacted him first before I pointed to the LGF posting, and asked him to respond. In not doing that, I wasn&#8217;t fair to him (and I&#8217;ve deleted my original tweet). He&#8217;s made it clear, moreover, that he does not share the beliefs of the hateful people who make those comments. I apologize.</p>

      <div class="entry-content e-content" itemprop="description articleBody">
    <p>UPDATED</p>
<p>It is Memorial Day in America, a Monday holiday that ends a three-day weekend &#8212; a holiday that has come to reflect so much of my nation&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>Once, the day was about sacrifice: honoring the American men and women who gave their lives in military service. But it became mostly about pleasure: barbecue grills, shopping, entertainment and general relaxation.</p>
<p>On this Memorial Day, Americans are fighting in two semi-official wars, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and participants in a NATO mini-war in Libya. They are volunteers. They are dying and being crippled in significant numbers, and apart from their families and friends in the U.S. they are essentially an afterthought to most of their fellow Americans. They bear the brunt of our government&#8217;s penchant for empire. They sacrifice. We grill our burgers.</p>
<p>My generation, the Baby Boomers, rules in Washington these days, and we refuse to cover even the financial cost of their sacrifice. With few exceptions, we&#8217;ve chosen to borrow and spend, in mind-boggling amounts. President George W. Bush and Congress pushed the fiscal cost of the Iraq war off the official budget, pretending that we could just toss it on the pile of other debts they and earlier governments had incurred. Under President Obama, the accounting is somewhat more honest but the costs are still being pushed to future taxpayers.</p>
<p>American society has never fully shared the sacrifices its people have undertaken to build a great nation. But the disproportion has become grotesque, deeply wrong. Yes, the men and women of our Armed Forces have volunteered, and they have earned our respect and support. But there have been consequences we&#8217;ve rarely considered. Relatively few people shoulder this enormous burden, and the rest of us have let them drift far from our eyes and minds, especially since we&#8217;re not even shouldering a financial burden for these wars. Military and non-military families might as well live in different societies, a dangerous cultural divide.</p>
<p>Which is why, among other reasons, that I believe it&#8217;s time to restore the military draft. It&#8217;s why I believe a new draft should include (and maybe start with) me and my generation &#8212; and should be one of many shared sacrifices America undertakes to restore a prosperous and just society. <em>And it&#8217;s why I will vote for any political candidate, of any party, who says these things out loud and promises to vote accordingly.</em></p>
<p>Granted, my cohort is too old for combat. No amount of training could put us in the kind of physical shape needed for that job. But we&#8217;re not too old to do many of the other jobs the military needs done. Military effectiveness is more than ever about brains than brawn. A good programmer or logistics expert serves differently, but those are enormously important skills.</p>
<p>There are millions of Boomers who could ably handle the rear-echelon tasks that the military spends vast energy and money to train 18-year-olds to do, and we could do them better. I wouldn&#8217;t like it, but if my number came up in a truly level draft &#8212; a draft that didn&#8217;t distinguish by age or financial station &#8212; I&#8217;d willingly go to Afghanistan to serve in any capacity that was useful, even if that was to write press releases.</p>
<p>The Boomer generation is loaded with talent. Consider all of the geniuses who operate Wall Street&#8217;s investment banks. Few of them have served, but surely the nation would be well served if we asked them to temporarily divert their energies to screwing our enemies instead of their clients and the American public. I&#8217;d be especially glad to see a draft that included hawkish commentators and members of Congress who are so proud to see other people&#8217;s children heading to war zones.</p>
<p>A draft would probably also save money. Today, taxpayers are borrowing countless billions to spend on highly paid &#8220;private security contractors&#8221; &#8212; the mercenary forces that fill the gaps we refuse to fill by not fielding fully equipped forces either in manpower or materiel. Sharing sacrifice would mean drafting men and women to serve at standard military wages.</p>
<p>To anticipate just a few of the objections to this idea, let me raise two obvious ones. First, the volunteer forces have been successes in many ways, especially the leg up they&#8217;ve given young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Military service has provided training, confidence and leadership skills to people who honor us and their nation by serving. The answer to this, of course, is a program of national service &#8212; a requirement that everyone spend a year or two in some capacity that America needs. (That&#8217;s a topic for another piece in this series.)</p>
<p>Another issue is what happens to older people&#8217;s income, not to mention their jobs, when they serve in a truly comprehensive military draft. We don&#8217;t want people heading off to Afghanistan and defaulting on their home mortgages. Asking a small business to preserve at least some income and positions would plainly require subsidies. But large companies already have enormous advantages; I&#8217;d require them to a) pay a portion of the difference between a military salary and what the employee was making; and b) to hold the position, or an equivalent one, open for the employee&#8217;s return. Sharing sacrifice, remember?</p>
<p>This argues, of course, for starting with the people who need subsidies the least, especially those who&#8217;ve inherited or made so much money already that even a 24-month major reduction in income would be barely noticeable. People whose incomes in recent years have been subsidized by the rest of us &#8212; such as Wall Street bankers &#8212; would be great candidates.</p>
<p>I know there are a thousand other problems with this suggestion. But I&#8217;m certain they are not show-stoppers. When Americans put their minds to creative problem-solving, we tend to find answers.</p>
<p>I honor our military men and women, people who have joined a tribe that the rest of us barely recognizes except on special days of the year and when they either make huge mistakes or claim big victories. But we dishonor them, and undermine our nation, with our unwillingness to face up to the true cost of war or to share the sacrifices more broadly; it&#8217;s easier to pursue war when we don&#8217;t bear the burden ourselves.</p>
<p>The majority of Americans who fear we are headed in the wrong direction are not stupid. They see a future entirely unlike the one they faced as young adults. The Boomers know in their guts that their children are likely to be <em>worse off</em>, not better off, than themselves. And they know who&#8217;s largely responsible: the generation that followed World War II&#8217;s &#8220;Greatest Generation,&#8221; a cohort that will someday be remembered as the Selfish Generation.</p>
<p>Unless. Unless we get honest with ourselves, at long last &#8212; and say the truth out loud as a society, and then act on it. Do we have leaders who will be honest with us?</p>
<p>The truth is, America is in clear and present danger, not just of decline but a frighteningly rapid descent into Second World status. We are in danger of turning this greatest experiment in self-governance into a corrupt, bankrupt, and violently polarized society.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s reinstate the draft, as Step One in the generation of shared sacrifice Americans will have to make. (Step Two, perhaps: Raise taxes to pay for these wars as we fight them.) Something called the United States of America will survive even if we don&#8217;t. But that nation will not be the America most of us want.</p>

      <div class="entry-content e-content" itemprop="description articleBody">
    <p>During the years when I&#8217;ve been an employee of large enterprises, as I am now, I&#8217;ve tended to make a donation through the United Way&#8217;s annual campaign. I&#8217;ve always targeted the donation, however, specifying what nonprofit organization I wanted my money to help.</p>
<p>I usually aim it at something the United Way finds politically difficult to help directly, such as <a href="http://plannedparenthood.org">Planned Parenthood</a>. My logic: I figured the umbrella group&#8217;s other recipients would do okay with the default selection by most folks.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;m sorry to say, the <a href="http://vsuw.org">Valley of the Sun United Way</a> (VSUW) in metropolitan Phoenix refused my directed gift, which I&#8217;d attempted to donate through <a href="http://asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>, my employer.</p>
<p>At the end of many conversations, emails and research, VSUW said it wouldn&#8217;t pass along the money to the <a href="http://acluaz.org/">ACLU Foundation of Arizona</a>. The reason? It wasn&#8217;t, in the opinion of VSUW, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization providing &#8220;health and human services&#8221; &#8212; the baseline requirement for a targeted donation. Instead, the VSUW told me, based on an employee&#8217;s check of the ACLU website, the ACLU is:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>more of an advocacy group than a health and human legal aid organization.  ACLU&#8217;s mission is more about protecting Constitutional rights and more about issues as opposed to serving individual people in need.  The work is more driven by the issue or position than the need of the individual.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The VSUW contrasted this with an agency it does consider worthy under their guidelines:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Community Legal Services of Arizona, also known as The William E. Morris Institute for Justice qualifies as a &#8220;health and human service&#8221; agency.</p>
<p>The William E. Morris Institute for Justice is a private non-profit agency established in 1996 to provide services to the legal services community, to other community-based agency advocates, and to select low-income clients in Arizona. In 1997, the Institute added an attorney who provides Legal-Services-Corporation precluded legal representation to low-income clients on a variety of issues.   The Institute conducts research, advocacy and training activities to enhance legal services provided to low-income households in Arizona.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p>If they&#8217;re right about Community Legal Services &#8212; definitely a worthy organization &#8212; they&#8217;re mistaken about the ACLU. I went beyond website PR and looked at the ACLU-Arizona IRS reporting forms, which to be fair I had to ask for from the organization.</p>
<p>The advocacy part of the ACLU operation is in the  501(c)(4) arm. The 501(c)(3) report clearly shows that the organization provides human services though legal representation and public education. I told this to the United Way and sent along the forms.</p>
<p>The United Way&#8217;s response: No again. They didn&#8217;t address the specifics beyond insisting that the ACLU did not, under their rules, qualify. (I probably hurt my case by asking if this was a political question more than anything else, given Arizona&#8217;s right-wing leanings. They furiously denied this had anything to do with it.)</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve withdrawn my donation, which was a generous one, giving instead  directly to the ACLU and (as I&#8217;ve already done) to one of the organizations the United Way does approve of. At this point, however, I&#8217;m not inclined to do anything with the United Way, or at least this branch of it.</p>
<p><em>Postscript</em>: By the way, the Arizona ACLU was basically useless during this process. The organization made no attempt to intervene, as far as I can tell, with either the university or United Way. And afterward, when I suggested the ACLU work with ASU and UW to fix this problem so it could become a designated beneficiary for gifts, the response was essentially, &#8220;Hmmm, interesting idea.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen no sign whatever that anyone bothered to pursue this. Who loses? The people who need the ACLU&#8217;s services the most. I hope the AZ ACLU&#8217;s legal services aren&#8217;t as dysfunctional as the fundraising.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s disheartening to see so many people refusing to get a flu shot this year, and just astonishing that people are resisting the H1N1 vaccine. Journalists have done the public no favors by giving paranoia the same level of authority that it gives the top medical and public-health professionals. </p>
<p>The evidence is crystal clear that any potential risk from the vaccine is vanishingly small compared to the risks of not getting it.</p>
<p>Which is why I got my seasonal flu shot already, and will get an H1N1 vaccine when it&#8217;s available, because it&#8217;s selfish not to do so. This is not just about me: It&#8217;s about the people I might expose if I get the flu.</p>

<p>The Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen">Shinkansen</a> &#8220;bullet train&#8221; runs at high speeds, but only when you see it up close do you realize how fast.
