    <p>As we <a href="http://rememberaaronsw.tumblr.com/post/40372208044/official-statement-from-the-family-and-partner-of-aaron">mourn</a> Aaron Swartz, let&#8217;s save energy for some anger &#8212; and activism.</p>
<p>Aaron, whose work was entirely about making our world a better place, died by his own hand. He was 26, and he had a history of depression. But the demons that carried him over the edge surely got a boost from the United States government, which was prosecuting Aaron in a manner that demonstrated contempt for the facts, fairness, and the justice system itself.</p>
<p>The case against Aaron, an object lesson of what happens when authority is cynically abused by the people in power, threatened more than Aaron&#8217;s liberty and his great work. It threatened us all.</p>
<p>So amid my grief for Aaron, I&#8217;m angry &#8212; and committed to working for honorable enforcement of rational laws, and for values Aaron exemplified in his short life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Aaron had made his presence known early. Among Philip Greenspun&#8217;s recollections in <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz/">this piece </a>is how a 12-year-old kid from Chicago found it easy to do what some professional computer people found hard.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t meet Aaron until 2002, at a World Wide Web conference in Hawaii, though I&#8217;d heard of him and his work. It was clear that he was in awe of the famous (in the Internet community, anyway) people, but it was equally obvious that they&#8217;d also heard about this prodigy and couldn&#8217;t wait to meet him. Even then Aaron had a remarkable clarity about his mission in life: to find and do stuff that a) was interesting; b) was fun; and, not least, c) would help everyone have more access to information we needed and could re-use in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>In a column soon after, I rued the demise of Napster, the music-sharing service, but remained hopeful bordering on confident that the Internet would thwart the growing attacks on openness and sharing. A promising harbinger was the then-emerging <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, founded by Larry Lessig. I noted that Aaron was working on the project and called him &#8220;an object lesson to the dinosaurs who run Hollywood and think they can control the uncontrollable,&#8221; adding, &#8220;The young people of this world will ultimately decide how this turns out.&#8221; Aaron was 15 at the time.</p>
<p>Aaron, in a beyond-productive decade, put a lot of interesting things on his agenda. The list of his activities &#8212; always pushing boundaries &#8212; is stunning. As Peter Eckersley <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/farewell-aaron-swartz">wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> blog, Aaron was always working for an open ecosystem:</p>
<blockquote><p>His contributions were numerous, and some of them were indispensable. When we asked him in late 2010 for help in stopping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combating_Online_Infringement_and_Counterfeits_Act">COICA</a>, the predecessor to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill">SOPA and PIPA Internet blacklist bills</a>, he founded an organization called <a href="http://demandprogress.org/">Demand Progress</a>, which mobilized over a million online activists and proved to be an invaluable ally in winning that campaign.</p>
<p>Other projects Aaron worked on included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">RSS</a> <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">specifications</a>, <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>, <a href="http://tor2web.org/">tor2web</a>, the <a href="http://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a>, and the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp">Chrome port of HTTPS Everywhere</a>. Aaron helped launch the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. He was a former co-founder at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, and a member of the team that made the site successful. <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/archive">His blog</a> was often a delight.</p></blockquote>
<p>As his projects bubbled along, and as his fame in the tech community grew, I wondered whether it would all go to his head &#8212; or worse, that he&#8217;d decide that getting fabulously rich was a more important mission in life. Once, comparing notes with a friend, we both fervently hoped that Aaron would never choose to be the next Bill Gates, at least in the predatory sense, because the world needed geniuses on the open-source and community side of the ledger. (Aaron laughed when I later mentioned this.) He stayed on track;  when he did make a bundle on the sale of Reddit, which he helped build, he just kept on doing those interesting things.</p>
<p>While Aaron seemed fundamentally shy in person, he did have an ego and a self-promotional sense that often (not always) served him well. He sometimes turned sour on his friends and mentors, sometimes in public ways. But they almost always forgave him. Because at heart, <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz-hero-of-the-open-world-rip/">said Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle</a>, Aaron was &#8220;among the best spirits of the Internet generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sadness today in my virtual community is nearly unbounded. My friends and their friends, like me, have been simply crushed by the news. You can get a sense of it from Matthew Ingram&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/12/the-web-responds-to-the-death-of-hacker-activist-aaron-swartz/">compilation</a> of links and context at GigaOm. My computer screen has blurred frequently through tears as I&#8217;ve read the heartbroken posts by, among so many others, <a href="http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=644">Quinn Norton</a> and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">Cory Doctorow</a>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An inchoate anger always mixes with sadness when someone dies so young. But today I&#8217;m seething at Aaron&#8217;s prosecution by a federal government that has rewarded torturers and banksters while in this case twisting the law to turn what amounts to minor trespassing into a &#8220;crime&#8221; worthy of decades in jail. You can read about it <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/feds-go-overboard-in-prosecuting-information-activist/">here</a>. Then read what <a href="http://unhandled.com/2013/01/12/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/">an expert witness was going to say</a> at the trial &#8212; testimony that surely would have led even the most gung-ho-for-government jury spend maybe 10 minutes in deliberations before acquitting Aaron.</p>
<p>Maybe this legal travesty was the Obama administration&#8217;s cynical campaign to put away someone it considered annoying. Maybe it was a case of a rogue prosecutor gone utterly berserk. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s a combination of ugly motives. But it&#8217;s infuriating and deeply scary to anyone who cares about a system of justice where the word &#8220;justice&#8221; means anything.</p>
<p>Like so many others, Larry Lessig, Aaron&#8217;s longtime friend and mentor, is mourning today. He&#8217;s <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">also publicly and correctly furious</a> at the prosecutors&#8217; foul behavior, and at the government&#8217;s utter lack of common sense or decency. As Larry wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government behind you.</p>
<p>For remember, we live in a world where the architects of the financial crisis regularly dine at the White House — and where even those brought to “justice” never even have to admit any wrongdoing, let alone be labeled “felons.”</p>
<p>In that world, the question this government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a “felon.” For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept, and so that was the reason he was facing a million dollar trial in April — his wealth bled dry, yet unable to appeal openly to us for the financial help he needed to fund his defense, at least without risking the ire of a district court judge.  And so as wrong and misguided and fucking sad as this is, I get how the prospect of this fight, defenseless, made it make sense to this brilliant but troubled boy to end it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120917/17393320412/us-government-ups-felony-count-jstoraaron-swartz-case-four-to-thirteen.shtml">Fifty years in jail</a>, charges our government. Somehow, we need to get beyond the “I’m right so I’m right to nuke you” ethics that dominates our time. That begins with one word: Shame.</p>
<p>One word, and endless tears.</p></blockquote>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shame on all of us, and shame on me, at least in this way: When Aaron was indicted, I didn&#8217;t do nearly enough to help. Some, like Larry Lessig, tried hard. Most of us, if we did anything, tweeted our outrage, sent emails of moral support, and went on with our lives, assuming that the justice system couldn&#8217;t be this insane.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too late for Aaron, but not for the rest of us.</p>
<p>We can honor Aaron&#8217;s life in the best way by doing what he did at <em>his</em> amazing best. We can work to expand an open Net and society, and to make &#8220;liberty&#8221; a word that means something again. Among many other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I lived in Massachusetts, where the U.S. Attorney with overall jurisdiction over Aaron&#8217;s case <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/07/patrick-reportedly-cites-prosecutor-vying-for-governor/0aEpGj5QqjvJfgSwgFNc7H/story.html">may run for governor</a>, I&#8217;d start working tomorrow to ensure that she couldn&#8217;t get elected dogcatcher. I&#8217;d also raise money to pay the best and bravest lawyer I could find, to ask the Massachusetts Bar Association to investigate how she and the assistant U.S. attorney in direct charge of the case had acted, and whether they deserved to keep their licenses to practice law.</li>
<li>No matter where I lived, I would ask my member of the U.S. House and my U.S. senators how they can allow the computer crime laws they passed to criminalize a violation of a terms of service &#8212; an interpretation that could put any one of us in jail under the Justice Department&#8217;s misuse of the law.  If the people representing me didn&#8217;t respond or expressed support for the administration&#8217;s you&#8217;re-all-potential-prisoners stance, I&#8217;d look for better representatives.</li>
<li>If I wrote software code for, say, Facebook or any other big company, or was a young coder considering a startup, I&#8217;d ask myself whether my work was worthy of Aaron&#8217;s memory &#8212; and if not, what I would do about that.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;d find and support organizations, like the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, that are carrying on the work Aaron championed, and did, to bring our culture and laws into the 21st Century in ways that value creativity, openness and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get angry. Then get busy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>More than a decade ago Aaron wrote a blog post about what his &#8220;virtual executor&#8221; should do <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/continuity">&#8220;If I get hit by a truck&#8230;&#8221;</a> &#8212; instructions that included a wish for the contents of his hard drives to be made public for posterity. He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, and BTW, I&#8217;ll miss you all.</p></blockquote>

      <div class="comment-content e-content p-summary p-name" itemprop="commentText name description"><p>We&#8217;re holding a vigil at the federal courthouse on Tuesday 2pm outside Ortiz&#8217;s staffs&#8217; offices (across the street technically so we don&#8217;t get arrested) with glowsticks rather than candles (I think Aaron would approve actually). </p>
<p>I plan to make up a sign that says, &#8220;Who Killed Aaron Swartz?&#8221;  And I&#8217;m cribbing my little EFF card to set up handouts for folks on their rights and obligations in case people come talk to us from across the street. 😉</p>
<p>Three generations of activists in my family since we came to this country.  </p>
<p>I was taught if the energy expended outstrips what they are seemingly trying to achieve, look for another end.  </p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t think this is about JSTOR, who isn&#8217;t pissed at Aaron, or about MIT either.  I used to run the campus-wide software licensing program at MIT when I was on staff, and they likely didn&#8217;t drop their stuff because the library subscription vendors are putting the screws to them over Aaron&#8217;s shenanigans, and they can&#8217;t afford to lose access to unique research datastores for the students/researchers/faculty &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t guarantee it but I can easily imagine it.</p>
<p>But what I can imagine is that the feds were waiting for Aaron to jaywalk so they could throw the book at him, because he&#8217;s capable of this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/426857/aaron-swartz-hacks-the-attention-economy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/426857/aaron-swartz-hacks-the-attention-economy/</a><br />
&#8220;This is what used to be called public relations, right? Propaganda. The difference now is that groups of everyday citizens can do it. I think that’s a big part of what we saw with the fight over SOPA. It was not about legal strategy or lobbyists. It was about how do we use these techniques to get people’s attention? Wikipedia went dark for a day, Tumblr asked all their bloggers to phone Congress—I think they had over 86,000 calls that one day. There was a guy who built a tool that would automatically dial each member of Congress and the head of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). If you wanted to inform everybody of your position, he could do it with a couple of clicks. What’s different about this fight is that a whole community took up the banner and tried to raise attention, and that it’s all organized over the Internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the immune system of the status quo.  They almost don&#8217;t even think about it, do they?  They identify threats and neutralize them.  It&#8217;s SOP.</p>
<p>My grandfather saw the feds put the screws to folks like Eugene Debs.</p>
<p>My dad worked with MLK and the SCLC, after a youth spent organizing with unions during the red scare.</p>
<p>The player&#8217;s names change but the dance is the same.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always felt a little like a coward because I grew up seeing so many people die and end up with ruined lives &#8212; I grew up with an ambition to be influential but never famous.  Everyone I knew with their head up above the crowd ended up dead or mangled beyond recognition, back in the 60s.  Summer of love, my ass.  There were other things going on for some of us.</p>
<p>But I still ended up doing what I ended up doing.  Because I can&#8217;t help seeing the change that has to be done.</p>
<p>Used to be we&#8217;d say &#8220;Don&#8217;t mourn, organize.&#8221;  But hey, it&#8217;s modern times &#8212; multitask.</p>

      <div class="comment-content e-content p-summary p-name" itemprop="commentText name description"><p>You wrote a brilliant piece.  I would have liked to have known Aaron Swartz.  Too bad.  It seems that the world has lost a good guy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the United States Attorney&#8217;s office and Boston FBI is not in tune with following the rule of law and there&#8217;s nothing anyone can or will do to stop it.</p>
<p>Official corruption and high crime in government is the new normal in America and every time the Justice Department &#8220;meets&#8221; a sunlight specialist &#8211; someone as ethical and honorable as Aaron Swartz, their job is to silence them by any means necessary.  Their monopoly on crime and using the Courts to complete crime trumps the law.</p>
<p>Most Americans do not know that it is a privilege, not a right to report official corruption and high crime in government with the expectation that it will be objectively investigated.  And, if you are not politically connected, you will be subjected to retaliation and/or selective prosecution by Federal law enforcement and the Courts.  </p>
<p>You write, &#8220;We can honor Aaron’s life in the best way by doing what he did at his amazing best. We can work to expand an open Net and society, and to make “liberty” a word that means something again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have just completed a follow up to my &#8220;Victim Impact Statement,&#8221; which I sent to the judge assigned to the case of former Special Counsel Scott Bloch.  If you would like to see how the FBI and DOJ operate, send for it.  My pleadings will give you some idea of what happened to Aaron Swartz and why.  </p>
