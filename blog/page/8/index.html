<p>In 2008 <a href="http://www.kk.org/about-me.php">Kevin Kelly</a>, author and former editor of Wired magazine, posted an incisive and influential essay, “1,000 True Fans.” He noted that the “long tail” in media is great for the aggregators (Google, Amazon, etc.) and the general public, but a problem for artists who weren&#8217;t stars. He <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> A creator, such as an artist, musician, photographer, craftsperson, performer, animator, designer, videomaker, or author &#8211; in other words, anyone producing works of art &#8211; needs to acquire only 1,000 True Fans to make a living.</p>
<p>A True Fan is defined as someone who will purchase anything and everything you produce. They will drive 200 miles to see you sing. They will buy the super deluxe re-issued hi-res box set of your stuff even though they have the low-res version. They have a Google Alert set for your name. They bookmark the eBay page where your out-of-print editions show up. They come to your openings. They have you sign their copies. They buy the t-shirt, and the mug, and the hat. They can&#8217;t wait till you issue your next work. They are true fans.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d experienced this several decades earlier, when I spent seven years playing music for a living. My band had the kinds of fans Kevin describes here. We played mostly around New England, and almost no matter where we appeared, at least a few of them would show up. They were, for us, much more than a friendly audience. They were friends, and part of a community.</p>
<p>Later, as a journalist practicing my trade relatively early in in the digital age, I discovered something else: My readers knew more than I did. This was blindingly obvious in retrospect, if not at the time. Not only did they know things I didn&#8217;t, but they could easily let me know via online communications.</p>
<p>When a blog software pioneer, Dave Winer, launched one of the first blogging platforms in 1999, I jumped aboard. It became essentially part of my newspaper column at Silicon Valley&#8217;s San Jose Mercury News, and the comments became a vital part of the conversations I was having with my readers.</p>
<p>As noted elsewhere in this ebook, I used the blog to post chapter drafts of my first book. The suggestions from readers were amazingly helpful, and the book was vastly better as a result.</p>
<p>Since then, our ability as authors to interact with our audiences has only grown &#8212; and I&#8217;m more convinced than ever that we need to move past the word &#8220;audience&#8221; and think about &#8220;users&#8221; and &#8220;community&#8221; in this context.</p>
<p>My more recent book, <a href="http://mediactive.com"><em>Mediactive</em></a>, isn&#8217;t just a book. It&#8217;s also a toolkit for modern media literacy. I offer blog-based lesson plans for teachers, and make everything available under a Creative Commons license to help spread my ideas on what I believe is an essential skill for the 21st Century. I also have great conversations in email, on Google+ an Twitter, and of course on my blogs, with people who want to talk about this.</p>
<p>Creating users and communities has meaning for an author&#8217;s bottom line as well. As crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and self-publishing tools of various kinds give artists ways to go around the traditional publishing industry cartel, authors can leverage their communities into support. We can reach our 1,000 fans much more easily, with less and less conversational and financial friction, than we ever could before.</p>
<p>A caution: Community development and management skills don&#8217;t come naturally to everyone. I failed badly at this in a digital news startup some years back, and I don&#8217;t claim to be an expert now. But having a conversation isn&#8217;t a chore for me, and what I gain from it is more than worth the effort.</p>
<p>Where can we take conversation and community? For one thing, we can recognize that a single price point &#8212; a book&#8217;s list or street price &#8212; is an absurdly limited view of the emerging book ecosystem. Some authors are experimenting with higher-priced special editions for what we might call their 250 Super Fans who not only buy everything but are happy to spend more for a special version. Or maybe there&#8217;s a premium-priced &#8220;dinner with the author&#8221; when he or she is visiting a new city.</p>
<p>One more caution: Conversations and communities take time. Authors have to ask themselves how much time they can afford to divert from their most essential job: writing and re-writing. If they neglect that, the rest won&#8217;t matter.</p>

    <p>In the news sphere, there can be endless arguments over whether this person or that person is a journalist. It&#8217;s a pointless conversation, because the real question is: What is journalism? Edge cases are easy. The <em>New York Times</em> is journalism. The &#8220;BlahBlahBlog&#8221; isn&#8217;t. But it gets blurry fast, and that&#8217;s where the conversation gets interesting.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting to have the same discussion in the book world. Again, the edge cases are easy. Here&#8217;s a book:</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stross.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-731" alt="stross" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stross-208x300.png" width="208" height="300" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stross-208x300.png 208w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stross.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /></a>Charlie Stross&#8217; <a href="https://www.powells.com/s?kw=stross%20atrocity%20archives&amp;PID=34782">novel</a> comes in print &#8212; bound pages &#8212; and in several ebook formats. It&#8217;s a book, period.</p>
<p>Not all books in the traditional realm are based on text, of course, though I&#8217;m hard-pressed to name a book that doesn&#8217;t include at least some text. Graphic novels and the heavy oversized volumes of photography we put on our coffee tables are just as much books as Charlie&#8217;s novel or <em>Moby Dick.</em> But just as a collection of blog posts isn&#8217;t a book, the latest installment in some comic series isn&#8217;t either (though we do call them comic books).</p>
<p>This is also a collection of bound pages. It&#8217;s not a book, at least not in the context I want to use here:</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/notebook.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-732" alt="notebook" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/notebook-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/notebook-225x300.jpg 225w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/notebook-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/notebook-624x832.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>The little notebooks I carry around, and into which I write notes of various kinds based on ideas and conversations, isn&#8217;t meant to be seen by others. It doesn&#8217;t start here and end there. It&#8217;s random. Book? Nope.</p>
<p>What about this volume, called <a href="http://www.betweenpageandscreen.com/"><em>Between Page and Screen</em></a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/between-page-and-screen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-733" alt="between page and screen" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/between-page-and-screen-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/between-page-and-screen-225x300.jpg 225w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/between-page-and-screen-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/between-page-and-screen-624x832.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Its authors call it &#8220;an augmented reality book of poems.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a video of how it works. Come back when you&#8217;ve watched it.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1s-JFxEmtpY" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Is this really a book? Or is it something else, even if part of it fits between two covers?</p>
<p>Now check out &#8220;The Elements&#8221; on the iPad:</p>

<p>I love it. Is it a book? Probably, but I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d say if I had to give a yes or no answer.</p>
<p>Welcome to the blurry world of tomorrow&#8217;s books &#8212; blurry in precisely the same way that some other media forms have become. It&#8217;s all about digital technology, of course, which subsumes everything that existed before, and then extends it into new realms. things bleed into each other: The New York Times posts excellently produced video online, and the BBC publishes text-based articles.</p>
<p>The experimentation in book publishing today is great to see. People are using technology to push out the boundaries. At some point, though, what they create no longer seems to fit into any category with historical antecedents.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked any number of people in recent months what a book is. The answers have ranged about as widely as you&#8217;d expect. Several zeroed in on a fairly simple but powerful notion: a book starts here, holds your attention for a non-trivial period of time, and ends there. Then again, so does a walk in the woods, or a film.</p>
<p>I suspect a book will be anything we decide to call one. Words take on new meanings. When was the last time you dialed a phone number by turning a little wheel on a landline with a wire connected to a wall plug? But you knew what I meant by dialing.</p>
<p>I worry that our shrinking attention spans will make traditional reading less and less relevant. But, ever optimistic, I&#8217;ll predict that books &#8212; whatever that means &#8212; do have a future, because we need them.</p>

    <p>A new production and financial ecosystem is emerging in book publishing, and it&#8217;s no longer centered around the publisher. The new ecosystem, more than ever, is author-centric.</p>
<p>Consider the people and institutions involved in a nonfiction author&#8217;s career. They include a literary agent, editor, publisher, publicist, speaking agent, and more. They work to help create and promote various products that derive from the author&#8217;s ideas and writing: books, speaking/consulting gigs, websites, and consulting, among other things. These produce different revenue streams, in distinct silos, and they oblige the author to make a variety of separate deals.</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-719" alt="author 1" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author-1-300x237.png" width="300" height="237" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author-1-300x237.png 300w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author-1.png 405w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-718" alt="author2" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author2-300x257.png" width="300" height="257" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author2-300x257.png 300w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author2.png 405w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The relationships get complicated fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-722" alt="author3" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author3-300x197.png" width="300" height="197" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author3-300x197.png 300w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author3.png 618w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It&#8217;s an inefficient system, and needs updating to reflect today&#8217;s realities.</p>
<p>What realities? For one thing, most authors should regard their books as elements of a larger career. For me, books are at least as much about promoting ideas that have made me more interesting, hence more valuable, as a speaker, teacher and short-form writer. Speaking/consulting agents and managers regard books as excellent calling cards for their clients.</p>
<p>How can we align these interests more efficiently? Other creative businesses have tried, with varying success. The music industry&#8217;s<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/arts/music/11leed.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"> &#8220;360&#8221; deals of recent years</a> have been one of the more notable attempts. In this model, a company (usually a record label) provides all management &#8212; including booking and promoting tours, not just recording and selling music &#8212; in return for percentage of all revenues the artist generates in record sales, live shows and ancillary sales. As the New York Times reported in 2007:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like many innovations, these deals were born of desperation; after experiencing the financial havoc unleashed by years of slipping CD sales, music companies started viewing the ancillary income from artists as a potential new source of cash. After all, the thinking went, labels invest the most in the risky and expensive process of developing talent, so why shouldn’t they get a bigger share of the talent’s success?</p></blockquote>
<p>Critics of this approach called the advantages for musicians dubious at best. Why cede even more control to an industry that has demonstrated vastly more concern for its own bottom line than its artists?</p>
<p>What should the new ecosystem look like? It&#8217;s not this:</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-723" alt="author4" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author4-300x218.png" width="300" height="218" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author4-300x218.png 300w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author4.png 572w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It&#8217;s this:</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-724" alt="author5" src="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author5-300x213.png" width="300" height="213" srcset="http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author5-300x213.png 300w, http://dangillmor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/author5.png 554w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The publishing industry has made forays into this field in small ways. Many publishers have in-house speakers bureaus for their authors, but this isn&#8217;t the publishers&#8217; speciality, raising questions about the value of the exercise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proposing new kinds of business arrangements where everyone involved in this collaborates, and takes risks. Everyone needs an incentive to make overall project a success. Each party should get a cut of all revenues, but at a lower percentage than they do today for their single slice. Done right, if everyone&#8217;s helping promote the author&#8217;s career, there should be a bigger pie.</p>
<p>Authors may decide to take more control themselves. They may farm out the overall management to a single person or firm. (Agencies will have to rethink what they do, and how.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see new kinds of business arrangements and contracts, where all participants see value in helping the other parts of the project. (If some of them say, “Aha, free money,” this won&#8217;t work.) We&#8217;ll need to see lots of experiments, many different kinds of deals. Some will fail despite the best efforts of all concerned, but that&#8217;s the nature of trying new things.</p>
<p>Above all, changing the ecosystem will require a willingness to experiment &#8212; and a decision by authors to take more control of their own lives.</p>

    <p><strong>Most of the smartest people don&#8217;t work in journalism. </strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an enormous amount of R&amp;D going on in digital media. Most of it isn&#8217;t happening inside the news industry.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://shirky.com">Clay Shirky</a> and others have pointed out, the low barrier to entry is fueling an enormous amount of experimentation. Most projects fail, but that&#8217;s a good thing, because when so many are being tried the small percentage that work will be a relatively big number.</p>
<p>Where is all this happening? Everywhere: universities, corporate labs, open-source repositories, startups, basements. The experiments are taking place inside and outside of companies, inside and outside the news industry (mostly outside), in Silicon Valley and out in the larger world. Many if not most of the valuable ideas, technologies and techniques are coming from projects whose creators have no journalistic intent &#8212; but whose work could and should be used in the journalism ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting dots </strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a need for a new kind of initiative to help sort things out. It&#8217;s not a traditional Center or Institute.</p>
<p>Imagine the inverse of a big corporate R&amp;D center, which tries to pick winners and makes relatively &#8220;safe&#8221; bets. Imagine, instead, a small team of, for lack of a better word, &#8220;connectors.&#8221; They identify interesting ideas, technologies and techniques &#8212; business models as well as editorial innovations &#8212; inside and outside the journalism sphere, but mostly outside. Then they connect these projects with people who can help make them part of tomorrow&#8217;s journalistic ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the connectors? </strong></p>
<p>They understand technology at a reasonably deep level. It&#8217;s not necessary to be a programmer. But it&#8217;s vital to know how to a) ask the right questions of the right people; b) recognize innovative technology and business models when they see them; and c) have a sound sense of the difference between cool and useful.</p>
<p>They appreciate journalism&#8217;s essential role in society, and how the craft is changing.</p>
<p>They have a broad array of contacts in the technology, business, education, philanthropic, investor and other sectors; the ability to have an intelligent conversation with any of them; and the desire to follow the dots to wherever they lead.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re capable of being evangelists, selling all these people not just on the need to combine great ideas with journalism, but also to take risks in new areas.</p>
<p><strong>Some principles of operation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An open process. Honor requests for NDAs prior to product launches, but the bias should be toward making everything available to anyone who&#8217;s interested. This would run contrary in many ways to the news industry&#8217;s traditional approach, but the tide is turning in a lot of shops where openness is correctly seen as an advantage.</li>
<li>Meet anyone, anywhere. Hold small news-focused workshops or mini-conferences to encourage more independent cross-fertilization. Might not be necessary given the explosion of startup camps, incubators, etc.</li>
<li>Measurement: Get the data, publish it and explore it as you go, and work with academics who are (at long last) turning to the real world for a lot of their research.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audience/users </strong></p>
<p>Traditional news organizations could really use this. I&#8217;m not saying they should stop doing their own R&amp;D, but this would provide some better leverage for those budgets, to the extent they still exist. Only a few major organizations have what it takes to do this in-house.</p>
<p><strong>Who else could use this? </strong></p>
<p><em>Investors outside the journalism business</em>. Angel investors and venture capitalists think &#8220;entertainment&#8221; when they think about media. They may be willing to place some of their high-risk, high-reward bets on projects that meet community information needs if they can be persuaded that there are also serious business models.</p>
<p><em>Non-media enterprises</em>. More and more corporations and nonprofits of all stripes are creating media. If they can help support innovations that also serve journalistic purposes, everyone wins. If they can be persuaded of the value of applying journalistic principles to what they produce, all the better. (If newspapers can sell advertorials, uh, native content, by the bushel, why can&#8217;t they &#8212; transparently &#8212; partner with some of these other entities?)</p>
<p><em>Individual (or small-team) media creators who can invest only their time</em>. An essential part of the connectors&#8217; role would be to identify open-source and other such projects that regular folks or small teams can put to good community-information use. (This includes communities of interest, not just geography, but if something useful for one it&#8217;ll almost certainly be useful to the other.)</p>
<p>The catalyzing opportunities here are fairly amazing. It is definitely worth the effort, because the payoff for journalism could easily dwarf the investment.</p>
<p>I recognize that those latter entities are competing with newspapers and traditional media. But my goal isn&#8217;t to see newspapers survive &#8212; much as I still love what they do when they do it well and hope they&#8217;ll survive in some form. It&#8217;s to see that whatever comes out of this messy period has value to communities, investors and everyone else in the emerging ecosystem.</p>

    <p>This is a WordPress blog &#8212; created and maintained using the great open-source team at WordPress.org. I&#8217;m a huge fan both of the software and the people behind it.</p>
<p>In my latest <a href="http://t.co/PBfJPSEy7h">Guardian column</a>, pegging off the Yahoo buyout of Tumblr, I explain why WordPress matters so much, and why I hope its founders never sell out. Key quote (from Matt Mullenweg, a WordPress founder):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">&#8220;We still need this platform for longer forms of self expression, and a place that people can have their own domain on the web, that really belongs to them, that they have complete control of it, all the way down to the software, the actual code executing on the server someplace in the cloud. You should be able to control every single line of that. And that&#8217;s the beauty of open source.&#8221;</span></p>

    <p>This week&#8217;s visit to Vermont, where I spoke to classes at the University of Vermont and did a public talk at Champlain College (the latter to benefit the <a href="http://vtdigger.org">VTDigger</a> journalism project), was great fun. Burlington&#8217;s local public access cable channel recorded the Champlain talk, and you can view it here:</p>

    <p>As we <a href="http://rememberaaronsw.tumblr.com/post/40372208044/official-statement-from-the-family-and-partner-of-aaron">mourn</a> Aaron Swartz, let&#8217;s save energy for some anger &#8212; and activism.</p>
<p>Aaron, whose work was entirely about making our world a better place, died by his own hand. He was 26, and he had a history of depression. But the demons that carried him over the edge surely got a boost from the United States government, which was prosecuting Aaron in a manner that demonstrated contempt for the facts, fairness, and the justice system itself.</p>
<p>The case against Aaron, an object lesson of what happens when authority is cynically abused by the people in power, threatened more than Aaron&#8217;s liberty and his great work. It threatened us all.</p>
<p>So amid my grief for Aaron, I&#8217;m angry &#8212; and committed to working for honorable enforcement of rational laws, and for values Aaron exemplified in his short life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Aaron had made his presence known early. Among Philip Greenspun&#8217;s recollections in <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz/">this piece </a>is how a 12-year-old kid from Chicago found it easy to do what some professional computer people found hard.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t meet Aaron until 2002, at a World Wide Web conference in Hawaii, though I&#8217;d heard of him and his work. It was clear that he was in awe of the famous (in the Internet community, anyway) people, but it was equally obvious that they&#8217;d also heard about this prodigy and couldn&#8217;t wait to meet him. Even then Aaron had a remarkable clarity about his mission in life: to find and do stuff that a) was interesting; b) was fun; and, not least, c) would help everyone have more access to information we needed and could re-use in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>In a column soon after, I rued the demise of Napster, the music-sharing service, but remained hopeful bordering on confident that the Internet would thwart the growing attacks on openness and sharing. A promising harbinger was the then-emerging <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, founded by Larry Lessig. I noted that Aaron was working on the project and called him &#8220;an object lesson to the dinosaurs who run Hollywood and think they can control the uncontrollable,&#8221; adding, &#8220;The young people of this world will ultimately decide how this turns out.&#8221; Aaron was 15 at the time.</p>
<p>Aaron, in a beyond-productive decade, put a lot of interesting things on his agenda. The list of his activities &#8212; always pushing boundaries &#8212; is stunning. As Peter Eckersley <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/farewell-aaron-swartz">wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> blog, Aaron was always working for an open ecosystem:</p>
<blockquote><p>His contributions were numerous, and some of them were indispensable. When we asked him in late 2010 for help in stopping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combating_Online_Infringement_and_Counterfeits_Act">COICA</a>, the predecessor to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill">SOPA and PIPA Internet blacklist bills</a>, he founded an organization called <a href="http://demandprogress.org/">Demand Progress</a>, which mobilized over a million online activists and proved to be an invaluable ally in winning that campaign.</p>
<p>Other projects Aaron worked on included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">RSS</a> <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">specifications</a>, <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>, <a href="http://tor2web.org/">tor2web</a>, the <a href="http://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a>, and the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp">Chrome port of HTTPS Everywhere</a>. Aaron helped launch the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. He was a former co-founder at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, and a member of the team that made the site successful. <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/archive">His blog</a> was often a delight.</p></blockquote>
<p>As his projects bubbled along, and as his fame in the tech community grew, I wondered whether it would all go to his head &#8212; or worse, that he&#8217;d decide that getting fabulously rich was a more important mission in life. Once, comparing notes with a friend, we both fervently hoped that Aaron would never choose to be the next Bill Gates, at least in the predatory sense, because the world needed geniuses on the open-source and community side of the ledger. (Aaron laughed when I later mentioned this.) He stayed on track;  when he did make a bundle on the sale of Reddit, which he helped build, he just kept on doing those interesting things.</p>
<p>While Aaron seemed fundamentally shy in person, he did have an ego and a self-promotional sense that often (not always) served him well. He sometimes turned sour on his friends and mentors, sometimes in public ways. But they almost always forgave him. Because at heart, <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz-hero-of-the-open-world-rip/">said Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle</a>, Aaron was &#8220;among the best spirits of the Internet generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sadness today in my virtual community is nearly unbounded. My friends and their friends, like me, have been simply crushed by the news. You can get a sense of it from Matthew Ingram&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/12/the-web-responds-to-the-death-of-hacker-activist-aaron-swartz/">compilation</a> of links and context at GigaOm. My computer screen has blurred frequently through tears as I&#8217;ve read the heartbroken posts by, among so many others, <a href="http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=644">Quinn Norton</a> and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">Cory Doctorow</a>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An inchoate anger always mixes with sadness when someone dies so young. But today I&#8217;m seething at Aaron&#8217;s prosecution by a federal government that has rewarded torturers and banksters while in this case twisting the law to turn what amounts to minor trespassing into a &#8220;crime&#8221; worthy of decades in jail. You can read about it <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/feds-go-overboard-in-prosecuting-information-activist/">here</a>. Then read what <a href="http://unhandled.com/2013/01/12/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/">an expert witness was going to say</a> at the trial &#8212; testimony that surely would have led even the most gung-ho-for-government jury spend maybe 10 minutes in deliberations before acquitting Aaron.</p>
<p>Maybe this legal travesty was the Obama administration&#8217;s cynical campaign to put away someone it considered annoying. Maybe it was a case of a rogue prosecutor gone utterly berserk. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s a combination of ugly motives. But it&#8217;s infuriating and deeply scary to anyone who cares about a system of justice where the word &#8220;justice&#8221; means anything.</p>
<p>Like so many others, Larry Lessig, Aaron&#8217;s longtime friend and mentor, is mourning today. He&#8217;s <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">also publicly and correctly furious</a> at the prosecutors&#8217; foul behavior, and at the government&#8217;s utter lack of common sense or decency. As Larry wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government behind you.</p>
<p>For remember, we live in a world where the architects of the financial crisis regularly dine at the White House — and where even those brought to “justice” never even have to admit any wrongdoing, let alone be labeled “felons.”</p>
<p>In that world, the question this government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a “felon.” For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept, and so that was the reason he was facing a million dollar trial in April — his wealth bled dry, yet unable to appeal openly to us for the financial help he needed to fund his defense, at least without risking the ire of a district court judge.  And so as wrong and misguided and fucking sad as this is, I get how the prospect of this fight, defenseless, made it make sense to this brilliant but troubled boy to end it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120917/17393320412/us-government-ups-felony-count-jstoraaron-swartz-case-four-to-thirteen.shtml">Fifty years in jail</a>, charges our government. Somehow, we need to get beyond the “I’m right so I’m right to nuke you” ethics that dominates our time. That begins with one word: Shame.</p>
<p>One word, and endless tears.</p></blockquote>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shame on all of us, and shame on me, at least in this way: When Aaron was indicted, I didn&#8217;t do nearly enough to help. Some, like Larry Lessig, tried hard. Most of us, if we did anything, tweeted our outrage, sent emails of moral support, and went on with our lives, assuming that the justice system couldn&#8217;t be this insane.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too late for Aaron, but not for the rest of us.</p>
<p>We can honor Aaron&#8217;s life in the best way by doing what he did at <em>his</em> amazing best. We can work to expand an open Net and society, and to make &#8220;liberty&#8221; a word that means something again. Among many other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I lived in Massachusetts, where the U.S. Attorney with overall jurisdiction over Aaron&#8217;s case <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/07/patrick-reportedly-cites-prosecutor-vying-for-governor/0aEpGj5QqjvJfgSwgFNc7H/story.html">may run for governor</a>, I&#8217;d start working tomorrow to ensure that she couldn&#8217;t get elected dogcatcher. I&#8217;d also raise money to pay the best and bravest lawyer I could find, to ask the Massachusetts Bar Association to investigate how she and the assistant U.S. attorney in direct charge of the case had acted, and whether they deserved to keep their licenses to practice law.</li>
<li>No matter where I lived, I would ask my member of the U.S. House and my U.S. senators how they can allow the computer crime laws they passed to criminalize a violation of a terms of service &#8212; an interpretation that could put any one of us in jail under the Justice Department&#8217;s misuse of the law.  If the people representing me didn&#8217;t respond or expressed support for the administration&#8217;s you&#8217;re-all-potential-prisoners stance, I&#8217;d look for better representatives.</li>
<li>If I wrote software code for, say, Facebook or any other big company, or was a young coder considering a startup, I&#8217;d ask myself whether my work was worthy of Aaron&#8217;s memory &#8212; and if not, what I would do about that.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;d find and support organizations, like the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, that are carrying on the work Aaron championed, and did, to bring our culture and laws into the 21st Century in ways that value creativity, openness and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get angry. Then get busy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>More than a decade ago Aaron wrote a blog post about what his &#8220;virtual executor&#8221; should do <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/continuity">&#8220;If I get hit by a truck&#8230;&#8221;</a> &#8212; instructions that included a wish for the contents of his hard drives to be made public for posterity. He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, and BTW, I&#8217;ll miss you all.</p></blockquote>
